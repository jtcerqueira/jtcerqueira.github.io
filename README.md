This is my personal web site, which I also intend to transform into a blog.

On it I will be trying to talk about unconventional usage of (or just unconventional) programming languages.

Enjoy. Feel free to contribute and I'll always link you on my site and redirect. 

Help is always needed, wanted and desired. 

Thank you!
